Welcome to the first lesson in Cloud-SPANâ€™s **Metagenomics with High Performance Computing** course!

Over the next two lessons we will cover the foundational skills and knowledge needed for the rest of the course. Once you are comfortable with these skills, we can move on to applying them to a metagenomics analysis workflow.

In this lesson we will learn how the files and directories on your computer are structured, as well as logging onto the cloud and using the **command line** (also known as the **shell** and the **terminal**) for the first time. It is heavily based on the first lesson of our [Prenomics course](https://cloud-span.github.io/prenomics00-intro/).

#### By the end of this lesson you will be able to:

- Explain the hierarchical structure of a file system.
- Understand what working directories, paths and relative paths are.
- Log onto to a running instance.
- Navigate a file system using the command line.
- Access and read help files for `bash` programs and use help files to identify useful command options.
- Work with hidden directories and hidden files.
