## Getting started

The first thing we need to do is log in to our cloud instance.

##### **1. Open the *cloudspan* folder you created for the course**

Open your file manager and navigate to the `cloudspan` folder (hint: we recommended you make the folder in your *Desktop* directory - but you might have made it somewhere else). If you cannot find the folder, you can remind yourself where it is stored by looking at the absolute path you wrote down in the previous episode.

The folder should contain the login key file we downloaded in the previous episode and nothing else.

##### **2. Right-click and open your machine's command line interface**

Now we can open the command line.

-   **Windows users**:

    -   Right click anywhere inside the blank space of the file manager, then select **Git Bash Here**. A new window will open - this is your command line interface, also known as the shell or the terminal. It will automatically open with your `cloudspan` directory as the working directory.

-   **Mac users**, you have two options:

    -   EITHER: Open **Terminal** in one window and type `cd` followed by a space. Do not press enter! Now open **Finder** in another window. Drag and drop the `cloudspan` folder from the Finder to the Terminal. You should see the file path leading to your `cloudspan` folder appear. Now press enter to navigate to the folder.

    -   OR: Open **Terminal** and type `cd` followed by the absolute path that leads to your `cloudspan` folder. Press enter.

##### **3. Login into your instance**

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
ssh -i login-key-instanceNNN.pem csuser@instanceNNN.cloud-span.aws.york.ac.uk
```

*Be sure to replace NNN with your own number, twice.*

## Reminder: our file structure

Before we start, here's a reminder of what our file structure looks like as a hierarchy tree:

<!-- ![A file hierarchy tree](../fig/blank_instance_file_tree_with_hidden.png){:width="400px"} -->

![A file hierarchy tree.](/images/blank_instance_file_tree_with_hidden.png){width="400px" fig-alt="A file hierarchy tree."}

Keep this in mind as we continue to navigate the file system, and don't hesitate to refer back to it if needed.

## Examining the contents of other directories

In the previous session we learned how to use `pwd` to find our current location within our file system. We also learned how to use `cd` to change locations and `ls` to list the contents of a directory.

By default, the `ls` commands lists the contents of the working directory (i.e. the directory you are in). You can always find the directory you are in using the `pwd` command. However, you can also give `ls` the names of other directories to view. Navigate to your home directory if you are not already there.

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
cd
```

Then enter the command:

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
ls cs_course
```

``` {.default filename="Output"}
data   databases
```

This will list the contents of the `cs_course` directory without you needing to navigate there.

The `cd` command works in a similar way.

Try entering:

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
cd
cd cs_course/data/
```

This will take you to the `data` directory without having to go through the intermediate `cs_course` directory.

## Navigating practice

Navigate to your home directory. From there, list the contents of the `illumina_fastq` directory.

## Solution

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
cd
ls cs_course/data/illumina_fastq
```

``` {.default filename="Output"}
ERR4998593_1.fastq  ERR4998593_2.fastq
```

## Full vs. Relative Paths

The `cd` command takes an argument which is a directory name. Directories can be specified using either a *relative* path or a full *absolute* path. The directories on the computer are arranged into a hierarchy. The full path tells you where a directory is in that hierarchy. Navigate to the home directory, then enter the `pwd` command.

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
cd  
pwd  
```

You will see:

``` {.default filename="Output"}
/home/csuser
```

This is the full name of your home directory. This tells you that you are in a directory called `csuser`, which sits inside a directory called `home` which sits inside the very top directory in the hierarchy. The very top of the hierarchy is a directory called `/` which is usually referred to as the *root directory*. So, to summarize: `csuser` is a directory in `home` which is a directory in `/`. More on `root` and `home` in the next section.

Now enter the following command:

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
cd /home/csuser/cs_course/.hidden
```

This jumps forward multiple levels to the `.hidden` directory. Now go back to the home directory.

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
cd
```

You can also navigate to the `.hidden` directory using:

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
cd cs_course/.hidden
```

These two commands have the same effect - they both take us to the `.hidden` directory. The first uses the absolute path, giving the full address from the root directory `/`. The second uses a relative path, giving only the address from the working directory. A absolute (full) path always starts with a `/`. A relative path does not.

You can usually use either a full path or a relative path depending on what is most convenient. If you want to reach a directory further down the same branch as your current working directory, it's easiest to use the relative path since it involves less typing. If you're trying to get to a directory in a different branch, it might be more convenient to use the full path instead of navigating "backwards" and then forwards.

Over time, it will become easier for you to keep a mental note of the structure of the directories that you are using and how to quickly navigate amongst them. We will be using the same directory structure for this whole course so navigating it should get easier as you progress.

## Relative path resolution

Using the file system diagram below, if `pwd` displays `/home/csuser/cs_course/data/illumina_fastq`, what will `ls ../nano_fastq` display?

Can you explain why?

<!-- ![Blank instance file tree.](../fig/blank_instance_file_tree_with_hidden.png){:width="300px"} -->

![Blank instance file tree.](/images/blank_instance_file_tree_with_hidden.png){width="400px" fig-alt="Blank instance file tree."}

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Solution

``` {.default filename="Output"}
ERR5000342_sub12.fastq
```

The command `ls ..` moves us up a folder level before we list the contents of `nano_fastq`.

### Navigational Shortcuts

The root directory is the highest level directory in your file system and contains files that are important for your computer to perform its daily work. While you will be using the root (`/`) at the beginning of your absolute paths, it is important that you avoid working with data in these higher-level directories, as your commands can permanently alter files that the operating system needs to function. In many cases, trying to run commands in `root` directories will require special permissions which are not discussed here, so itâ€™s best to avoid them and work within your home directory. 

Dealing with your home directory is very common. The tilde character, `~`, is a shortcut for your home directory. In our case, the `root` directory is **two** levels above our `home` directory, so `cd` or `cd ~` will take you to`/home/csuser` and `cd /` will take you to `/`.

Navigate to the `illumina_fastq` directory:

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
cd
cd cs_course/data/illumina_fastq
```

Then enter the command:

``` {.bash filename="Code"}
ls ~
```

``` {.default filename="Output"}
bin  cs_course software
```

This prints the contents of your home directory, without you needing to type the full path.

The commands `cd`, and `cd ~` are very useful for quickly navigating back to your home directory. We will be using the `~` character in later lessons to specify our home directory.
