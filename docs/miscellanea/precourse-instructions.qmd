## Overview

The software and data used for analysis during the course are hosted on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) virtual machine (VM) instance. A copy of such an instance that requires no previous setup by you will be made available to you at no cost by the Cloud-SPAN team.

To access and use the resources in your AWS instance from your personal computer, you will use a command-line interface (CLI) program that is widely known as the *shell* or *terminal*. The shell is available by default for Linux and Mac users (so they don't need to install any software).

Windows users will need to install Git for Windows on their computer as described below **prior to the course**. Git includes Git Bash which is a Windows version of the Unix Bash shell, the most widely used shell and the default shell in Linux systems.

You will need to use a laptop or desktop to take this course. Due to the need to both follow the instructor in Zoom and perform analyses, tablets and iPads are not suitable for using during this course. Having both an up to date browser and a stable internet connection is important.

Before the course you will receive via email the information that you will need to log in to your AWS instance. Your instructor will show you how to log in.
